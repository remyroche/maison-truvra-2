# Maison Trüvra - E-commerce Platform

## Description

Maison Trüvra is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed for selling artisanal products. It features a customer-facing website for browsing and purchasing products, and a comprehensive admin panel for managing inventory, orders, users, and more. A key innovation of this platform is its **serialized inventory management system**, where each individual item receives a unique identifier (UID), a QR code, and a digital "passport" detailing its origin and characteristics. This provides enhanced traceability and authenticity for customers.

The platform supports both B2C (Business-to-Consumer) and B2B (Business-to-Business) functionalities, including professional invoicing for B2B clients.
